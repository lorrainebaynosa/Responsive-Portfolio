                    My nursing career has spanned nearly nineteen years. Within that time frame, I have held clinical,
                    administrative, and management positions in Nursing and had the opportunity to work at several
                    facilities within the California region. Given my passion for Business, I decided to attend a UCLA Coding Bootcamp, with the hope of creating
                    applications that may target some of the efficiencies in healthcare. Hopefully, these products will
                    transform healthcare as we know it.

                <p> I love to travel! I even got scuba-certified and swam with the whale sharks in Cebu, Philippines.
                    Being a foodie, I love to try all cuisines.</p>
